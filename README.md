# measurement_simulability
This code computes the minimum distance between a measurement assemblage M^eta, consisting of noisy versions of Pauli mesurements, and the set of assemblage that can be simulated by two measurements with a set of preprocessing distribution on a finite grid, i.e., a grid approximation of SIM_2.
